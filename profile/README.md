## Howdy, pardner 👋

You can find most of the information anyone would want to know about the [Austin DevOps Meetup here](https://www.meetup.com/austin-devops/)!

We keep some bits and bytes regarding the meetup here, but mostly it's an artifact of a time when folks wanted to do a lot more technology stuff around the meetup and it mostly didn't pan out. We appreciate it, though!

You can [propose a talk to the meetup here](https://github.com/Austin-Devops/talks), if you want. Otherwise, we'll probably see you on the 2nd Monday of the month wherever Austin DevOps can be found!

# How to contribute

Thanks for checking out the GitHub profile for the Austin Devops Meetup! We ask that anyone contributing to the repository be a member and regular participant in the meetup. If you cannot participate in the in-person meetup due to health concerns or time constraints, join us in the #atxdevops channel on HangOps Slack. 

Aside from that there's really not much to say - we keep some documentation here about how the community operates (or how we want it to operate), have a workflow for talk submissions via GitHub, and random other bits and bobs. Maybe someday this will develop into something which requires more code, but we tend to operate on the principle of "minimum viable bother" - where whatever the minimum amount of effort required to bring folks together to have good inclusive discussions about topics which relate to the practice of devops is, that's what's likely to go into it at a given time.
